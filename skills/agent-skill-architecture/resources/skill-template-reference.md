2. Question 2?
3. Question 3?

**Scoring:**
- 3/3 YES → [Strong action]
- 2/3 YES → [Consider action]
- 1/3 YES → [Don't do action]

**Examples:**
- ✅ 3/3 YES: [Example] because [reasons]
- ❌ 1/3 YES: [Example] because [reasons]
```

# Required config
key: value
```

**Usage Pattern:**
```[language]
// Standard pattern we use
const result = await tool.call({
  param1: value1,
  param2: value2  // IMPORTANT: [critical note]
})
```

**Error Handling:**
```[language]
// Graceful fallback pattern
try {
  await tool.call()
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback strategy
}
```

**Common Issues:**

## Checklist Before Finalizing

Copy this checklist and verify before creating the skill:

```markdown
### Structure
- [ ] Directory: `.claude/skills/skill-name/`
- [ ] SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Tier 3 files self-contained (if needed)
- [ ] No nested references (one level only)

### Metadata
- [ ] name: lowercase-with-hyphens (max 64 chars)
- [ ] description: third-person, <1024 chars
- [ ] Description describes WHEN not HOW
- [ ] Domain-specific name (not generic)

### Content
- [ ] <500 lines (ideally 150-300)
- [ ] Only project-specific content
- [ ] No generic explanations
- [ ] WHY included for decisions
- [ ] Anti-patterns documented
- [ ] Scannable format (tables/bullets)

### Quality
- [ ] Would help future me with amnesia?
- [ ] Is this obvious to Claude? (if yes, remove)
- [ ] Is this project-specific? (if no, remove)
- [ ] Every section actionable?

### Integration
- [ ] Added to agent skills: field (if needed)
- [ ] Referenced in commands (if needed)
- [ ] Tested invocation
```

## Example: Converting Documentation to Skill

**Source:** `docs/DATA_ACCESS_PATTERNS.md` (800 lines)

**Step 1: Extract signal**
```yaml
Signal (keep):
  - Circular dependency bug (line 45-78)
  - Client selection table (line 120-145)
  - Split Query Pattern (line 200-230)
  - Type regeneration command (line 650)

Noise (remove):
  - "What is [service]?" (line 1-30)
  - "How to install [tool]" (line 80-110)
  - Basic CRUD examples (line 300-500)
  - Generic access control explanation (line 550-620)
```

**Step 2: Create SKILL.md (180 lines)**
```markdown
---
name: data-access-patterns
description: Use when working with access control policies, client selection, or database migrations. Documents critical bugs and project-specific patterns.
---

# Data Access Patterns

## Purpose
Documents [project] specific data access patterns and critical mistakes.

## Access Control Rule (CRITICAL)

**Rule:** NEVER query the same table in its access policy.
**Why:** Causes circular dependency, system overflow crash.
**We hit this:** data_table checking data_table.active → prod crash.

**Fix: Split Query Pattern**
[Minimal example]

## Client Selection

[Table showing when to use which]

## Quick Reference
```bash
# Type regeneration
npm run db:types
```
```

**Step 3: Create Tier 3 (optional)**
```markdown
# access-policies.md

[Full access policy examples with detailed code]
```

**Result:**
- Before: 800 lines (60% noise)
- After: 180 lines SKILL.md + 150 lines Tier 3 (100% signal)
- Reduction: 60% token savings

---

## Tips

**Start minimal** - Create basic template, expand as patterns emerge.

**Focus on WHY** - Every rule should explain the problem it solves.

**Document mistakes** - "Critical Mistakes We Made" is the most valuable section.

**Use tables** - Quick reference tables are highly scannable.

**Keep it under 500 lines** - If over 500, split to Tier 3 files.

**Test with "Would Claude know this?"** - If yes, it's noise.
