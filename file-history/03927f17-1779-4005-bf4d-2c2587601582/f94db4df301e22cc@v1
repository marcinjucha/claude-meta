# Explain iOS + TCA Code

Analyze and explain iOS/TCA code focusing on:

**TCA Components:**
- State structure and data flow
- Action organization (ViewAction, ResponseAction, DelegateAction)
- Reducer logic and effect patterns
- Dependencies (@Dependency, makeWithDeps)
- Navigation patterns (@Presents, NavigationStack)

**Clean Architecture:**
- Layer identification (Presentation, Business, Data, Model)
- Use Case vs Service pattern
- Repository abstractions
- Dependency flow

**Implementation Details:**
- SwiftUI view composition
- Design system usage (Colors, L10n, .defaultFont())
- Async/await patterns
- Publisher subscriptions

**Agent Used:** May invoke `tca-developer` or `ios-architect` depending on focus.
