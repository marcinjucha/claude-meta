# Create New Feature

Generate complete feature structure following feature-based architecture:

**Generates Full Feature Structure:**
```
features/[feature-name]/
├── actions/[feature]-actions.ts      # Server Actions + Zod validation
├── components/[feature]-form.tsx     # React component with React Hook Form
├── logic/[feature]-use-case.ts       # Business logic with executePromise
├── logic/[feature]-repo.ts           # GraphQL repository
├── logic/[feature]-type.ts           # DTO types
└── __tests__/
    ├── [feature]-actions.test.ts     # Actions tests (mock Use Cases)
    ├── [feature]-use-case.test.ts    # Use Cases tests (mock GraphQL)
    └── [feature]-test-utils.ts       # Test fixtures
```

**Includes:**
- Complete dependency injection setup
- Proper layer separation
- executePromise and ClientResult patterns
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- GraphQL queries/mutations with fragments
- Error handling at each layer
- Comprehensive tests with mocks

**Follows Reference Implementation:**
- Patterns from `features/checkout/`
- Uses `lib/error-handling.ts` utilities
- Uses `lib/graph-ql/graphql-utils.ts` helpers
- Follows `.cursor/rules/` architecture guidelines

**Agent Used:** Invokes `feature-architect-agent`.

## Usage
```
/feature [feature_name] [description]
```

## Parameters
- `feature_name`: Name of the feature (e.g., "product", "order", "user-profile") (required)
- `description`: Optional brief description of the feature functionality

## Example
```
/feature product "CRUD operations for product management with image upload"

This will create a complete feature with all necessary files following the architecture.
