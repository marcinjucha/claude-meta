# Debug Next.js + Feature-Based Architecture

Analyze Next.js/React code for bugs and debugging strategies. Focus on:

**Feature Architecture Issues:**
- State not updating (missing "use client", React Hook Form issues)
- Server Actions not firing or returning errors
- executePromise not catching errors properly
- ClientResult not handled in components
- Dependency injection missing in Actions

**Next.js-Specific Issues:**
- Server/Client boundary issues ("use server"/"use client" directives)
- Hydration mismatches
- Server Actions not working (FormData issues, redirect problems)
- GraphQL mutations/queries failing
- Environment variables not accessible

**React-Specific Issues:**
- Components not re-rendering (missing useState/useEffect)
- React Hook Form errors (validation, submission, error display)
- Memory leaks (missing cleanup, uncanceled subscriptions)
- Performance issues (excessive re-renders, missing memoization)

**General Issues:**
- Null/undefined handling
- Race conditions in async code
- Error handling gaps (missing executePromise, try/catch)
- Type errors (TypeScript issues)

Provides specific debugging steps, console.log suggestions, and fixes following feature-based architecture patterns.

**Agent Used:** This command may invoke `architecture-validator-agent` or `use-case-agent`.

## Usage
```
/debug [file_path] [error_description]
```

## Parameters
- `file_path`: Path to the file to debug (required)
- `error_description`: Optional description of the error or issue
