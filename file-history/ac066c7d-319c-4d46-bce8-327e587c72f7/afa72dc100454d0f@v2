# Debug iOS + TCA Code

Analyze iOS/TCA code for bugs and debugging strategies. Focus on:

**TCA-Specific Issues:**
- State not updating (missing @ObservableState, BindingReducer)
- Effects not firing or canceling
- @Dependency crashes (access in TaskGroup)
- Memory leaks (missing weakSink, uncanceled effects)
- Navigation not working (@Presents, PresentationAction)

**iOS-Specific Issues:**
- SwiftUI rendering issues (view not updating, layout breaks)
- Memory leaks (retain cycles, publishers)
- Crashes (force unwraps, threading issues)
- Performance issues (main thread blocking, excessive renders)

**General Issues:**
- Null/optional handling
- Race conditions in async code
- Error handling gaps

Provides specific debugging steps, breakpoint suggestions, and fixes.

**Agent Used:** This command may invoke `tca-developer` agent for TCA debugging.
