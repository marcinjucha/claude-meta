# Manage Git - Intelligent Commit Message Generation

Generate high-quality conventional commit messages from staged git changes. Analyzes diff + file contents → generates title + body → user reviews/edits → commits.

## Usage

```bash
/manage-git
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Must have staged changes (`git add` files first)

**Process:**
1. Analyzes staged changes + reads modified files
2. Generates commit message (title + body, NO footer)
3. Shows message for user review
4. User can: accept / edit / regenerate / cancel
5. Commits with final message

**Speed:** 1-2 minutes

---

## 🚫 ZERO HALLUCINATIONS

**Why this rule exists:** Previous audit added invented metrics to commit messages ("40% faster iteration", "30-minute test run") - required cleanup.

**NEVER invent:**
- ❌ Impact metrics ("improved performance by X%", "reduced bugs by Y%")
- ❌ Before/after measurements ("2hr→30min", "30%→0%")
- ❌ Production context not in diff or user message

**ONLY write about:**
- ✅ Changes visible in git diff
- ✅ User-provided context (use their exact words for WHY)
- ✅ Technical changes visible in code structure

---

## Phases

```
0: Context Analysis       (orchestrator - inline, quick status check)
1: Message Generation     (project-manager-agent with git-commit-patterns)
2: Review & Confirmation  (orchestrator - inline, user checkpoint)
3: Execute Commit         (orchestrator - inline, git commit)
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **INVOKE Phase 1 with Task tool** - actually invoke project-manager-agent, don't describe what it will do
2. **Read entire modified files** - Agent needs file contents, not just diff
3. **Phase 2 is only user checkpoint** - User accepts/edits/regenerates here
4. **Abort if nothing staged** - Stop workflow gracefully
5. **Minimal interaction** - Streamlined flow, no unnecessary questions

---

## Phase Details

### Phase 0: Context Analysis (Inline)

**Actions:**

1. Check staged changes:
```bash
git status
git diff --cached --stat
```

2. If nothing staged, stop:
```
No staged changes detected. Please stage files first:
  git add <file>...
  git add -A

Then run /manage-git again.
```

3. If changes staged, continue:
- Categorize change type: feat / fix / refactor / test / docs / chore / perf
- Categorize change complexity: SIMPLE or COMPLEX
  - **SIMPLE:** 1-3 files, single concern, single decision (example: fix typo, add one feature flag, rename variable)
  - **COMPLEX:** 4+ files, multiple concerns, multiple architecture decisions (example: refactor structure, add new agent, enhance workflow)
- Extract ticket from branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Get recent commits for style: `git log --oneline -5`

**Proceed to Phase 1. Pass complexity categorization to agent.**

---

### Phase 1: Message Generation (Agent)

**Agent:** project-manager-agent

**Sufficient context for quality:**

```yaml
Input needed:
  - Git diff output (staged changes: git diff --cached)
  - Modified file contents (read each file entirely)
  - Change categorization (type from Phase 0)
  - Ticket number (extracted from branch, or "none")
  - Recent commit style (git log --oneline -5)

NOT needed:
  - Full git history beyond recent 5 commits
  - Project documentation (focus on THIS change only)
```

**Prompt to agent:**

```
Generate git commit message for staged changes.

STAGED CHANGES:
[git diff --cached output]

MODIFIED FILES:
[Read entire contents of each modified file]

CATEGORIZATION:
- Type: [feat/fix/refactor/...]
- Complexity: [SIMPLE or COMPLEX]
- Ticket: [TICKET-NUM or "none"]

RECENT COMMITS (for style consistency):
[git log --oneline -5]

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Title format: "[TICKET-NUM] type: subject" (max 72 chars including ticket)
   - If no ticket: "type: subject"

2. Body: Natural prose focusing on WHY, not HOW
   - WHY: Business context, reasoning, constraints, decisions
   - NOT HOW: File changes, implementation details, line-by-line diff

   **LENGTH LIMITS (critical):**
   - SIMPLE changes: 1-2 paragraphs (~100-150 words)
   - COMPLEX changes: 2-3 paragraphs (~200-250 words MAX)

   **NOTE:** If more than 3 key decisions → pick TOP 2 most important
   Don't list all decisions. Focus on what matters most.

3. SIGNAL vs NOISE: Only include information that explains the decision
   - ❌ "Added function to filter surveys" (obvious from code)
   - ✅ "Filtering needed because users reported scrolling 300+ items. Chose query-based approach to support offline mode (40% usage time)."
   - ❌ "Modified AuthService.ts and updated imports" (visible in diff)
   - ✅ "OAuth required for third-party integrations. PKCE prevents authorization code interception (CVE-2008-5461)."
   - ❌ "Consolidated 8 agents to 6, added verification-specialist, enhanced implement-phase, improved build verification, added code-validation anti-patterns" (too many details)
   - ✅ "Consolidated agents (8→6) to reduce context bloat. New verification-specialist agent catches implementation bugs before expensive test cycles."

   ANY NO = HALLUCINATION → Reject immediately.

   DO NOT include:
   - Generic commit messages ("fix bug", "update code")
   - Invented metrics ("30% faster", "reduced by 50%")
   - Assumed business context not provided

4. NO footer (exception: only BREAKING: footer if breaking change)

Skills: Use git-commit-patterns (WHY-focused messaging, Signal vs Noise)

Output: Full commit message (title + body)
- Focus on OUTCOME not list of changes
- Be direct and concise
- Each paragraph = 1 key decision + business impact
```

**Proceed to Phase 2.**

---

### Phase 2: Review & Confirmation (Inline)

**This is the only user checkpoint.**

1. Display generated message:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
GENERATED COMMIT MESSAGE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
[title line]

[body paragraphs]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

2. User options:

```
- Type "accept" → Commit with this message
- Type "edit: [your changes]" → Apply edits and show updated message
- Type "regenerate" → Generate new message (reinvoke agent)
- Type "cancel" → Abort workflow

Your choice?
```

3. Handle user choice:

**If "accept":**
→ Proceed to Phase 3 (commit)

**If "edit: [changes]":**
→ Apply edits to message
→ Show updated message
→ Ask: "Commit with this message? (accept/edit/cancel)"
→ Loop until "accept"

**If "regenerate":**
→ Go back to Phase 1 (invoke agent again)

**If "cancel":**
→ Stop workflow (no commit)

---

### Phase 3: Execute Commit (Inline)

**Actions:**

1. Create commit:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[approved message from Phase 2]
EOF
)"
```

2. Verify and show result:

```bash
git log -1 --oneline
git show --stat HEAD
```

3. Display result:

```
✅ Commit created successfully!

Commit: [hash] [title]

Next steps:
- Review: git show HEAD
- Push: git push
- Create PR: gh pr create
```

**Command complete.**

---

## Commands

- `continue` - Proceed to next phase (Phase 0 → 1 → 2 → 3)
- `back` - Return to previous phase
- `stop` - Exit command without committing
- `accept` - (Phase 2 only) Accept message and commit
- `edit: [changes]` - (Phase 2 only) Edit message
- `regenerate` - (Phase 2 only) Regenerate message (reinvoke agent)
- `cancel` - (Phase 2 only) Abort workflow

---

## Sufficient Context Principle

**For Phase 1 agent (project-manager-agent):**

**Provide:**
- ✅ Git diff output (staged changes only)
- ✅ Modified file contents (entire files, not just diff sections)
- ✅ Change categorization (type, ticket number)
- ✅ Recent commits (for style consistency)
- ✅ git-commit-patterns skill (preloaded)

**Do NOT provide:**
- ❌ Full git history (just recent 5 commits)
- ❌ Generic guidelines (agent has skill)
- ❌ Project documentation (agent focuses on THIS change)

**Test question:**
> "Can agent produce HIGH QUALITY commit message with this context alone?"
> - Git diff → shows WHAT changed
> - File contents → shows WHY changed
> - Recent commits → ensures style consistency
>
> Result: **SUFFICIENT** ✅
